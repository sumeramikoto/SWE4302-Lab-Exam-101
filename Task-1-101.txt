The following code smells were found in the inventorySystem.java file:

Line 6-198, Large Class, The inventorySystem class is trying to do too much, having multiple classes and methods within it and thus carrying too many responsibilities.

Line 41-42, Long Parameter List, 7 arguments are being passed to the addProduct method, which is way too much.

Line 44-67, Conditional Complexity, In this block of code, a total of 5 if statements were nested. Thus, it made the whole logic very complex.

Line 78-98, Switch Statements, Switch cases were used here.

Line 41-72, 74-102, 132-167, Long Function, The functions in the aforementioned lines of code (addProduct, calculateFinalPrice and processOrder respectively) are very long.

Line 134, 153, Magic Number, It's not clearly understood why the number -1 is being returned here.
